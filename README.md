# RubikFromZero

**This is me trying to solve Rubik's cube from zero.**

When I was a kid I hated it.
Now, one of my daughters has one.
I have been trying to solve it by "hand and head", but so far I have failed.

**I have never read or heard anything about how to model or how to solve it.**
And I pretend to stay like that until I change my mind. 

This is just a personal project, backed up at GitHub.
Expect nothing from it.
I'll probably just slightly touch the simplistic approaches if anything at all.
It's very probable that I'll forget this at some point and never reach an interesting point.
And it's also probable that I'm too na√Øve for thinking I would ever solve anything.

Main file is the notebook [Rubik.ipynb](Rubik.ipynb).
